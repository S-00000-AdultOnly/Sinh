I have to tell you,
The criticism of our common practice,
Of permitting very young people to accidentally engage,
In masturbation with electionic media,
And masturbation with media could be called sex,
Which equation is at present surprising,
Is already pertinent,
And makes me fear for,
And wonder about, and hope for,
Some of our very beloved people,
Whom we have allowed to be on either side of that transaction,
And I fear because we have not defined,
A policy specifically adressing masturbating with media,
But we would allow ourselves,
Because of the persuasive power of the media,
Possibly being counter to the designs of some one,
To be aggravated by it happening.

"If some person is making it true,
 That it has injured you.
 Remember that the person's purpose,
 Of having the story of the assault to tell,
 Is to commit another injury,
 To the listener.
 The assailant is dismissed,
 Because the assailant would injure fine thoughts."

 About what you are thinking,
